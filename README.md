# Hamburger Sidebar

Hamburger sidebar build with html, css, javascript.
I gave my best with commenting code :D 
In CSS file there are bunch of variables that used and I didn't. I been thinking to try SASS, but since I didn't plan to use @if, @else or some other propreties, only for variables or nesting I didn't see a point. 

Javascript is very simple for something like this. 

P.S
For logo I used paint :D
